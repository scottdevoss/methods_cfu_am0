# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

I am most proud of working through each challenge and figuring out how to pass multiple arguments. It was easy to add one arguments but it took me a few attempts to get the correct code and syntax to pass multiple arguments. Now I feel more confident on how to use it in the future and solving more complex challenges. 

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

It really makes it easy to store and access data for multiple items without having to write out multiple lines of code. I have a basic understanding of methods and I am excited to continue to add to its use case.
